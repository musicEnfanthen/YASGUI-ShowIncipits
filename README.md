# YASGUI-ShowIncipits
Quick and dirty user script (a.k.a. Greasemonkey script) to turn PAE incipits retrieved with YASGUI (e.g. from RISM) into nice Verovio renderings

## Install:
1. Install a userscript browser extension:
  * Greasemonkey (Firefox): https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
  * Tampermonkey (Chrome et al): https://www.tampermonkey.net/
  (n.b. only tested with Greasemonkey / Firefox)
  
2. Open the raw YASGUI-ShowIncipits userscript in your browser: https://github.com/musicog/YASGUI-ShowIncipits/raw/master/YASGUI-ShowIncipits.user.js

3. You should get a pop-up asking you to install the user script. Do so. 

## Usage:
1. Go to http://yasgui.org using the browser on which you've installed the user script.
2. Specify https://data.rism.info/sparql (or any endpoint that has PAE incipits) as the SPARQL endpoint at the top
3. Write a SPARQL query that selects PAE strings into a variable called `?incipit`. Example query:
```
PREFIX dcterm: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
PREFIX bsbM: <http://bsb-muenchen.de/ont/bsbMusicOntology#>
SELECT DISTINCT ?work ?title ?pae ?incipit WHERE {
      ?work dcterm:title ?title ;
            bsbM:incipit ?incipit .
      BIND(?incipit as ?pae) .
}
LIMIT 50
```
4. Ensure that "Table" is selected as the results format. Within a couple of seconds of the results loading, you should see the PAE in the "incipit" column replaced with an equivalent Verovio rendering. You can specify another query returning incipits and have them rendered to Verovio again, without reloading the page.
